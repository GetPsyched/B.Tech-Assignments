        Spiraling around your lonely nights,
        Altering your perspective about former fights.
        Moving around pebbles of ambition,
        Igniting them forming a spark of action.

        Knitted into memory are gauche fantasies,
        Seized with ropes of reality are these insanities.
        Huddled together are pending plans,
        Awaiting to materialize into something grand.

        Thwarted are the dreams of success,
        Rendered mute by the grip of distress.
        Idealized in the thinking,
        Personified in the making.

        Aren't these dreams cruelly a
        Thing of beauty?
        Hidden between hopes and wishes,
        Idled are these dreams deficit of riches.
